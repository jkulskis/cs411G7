### Idea 1 - The final project 
*Note: Please see top-level README for a fuller description of the final project.*

We want to create a web application that generates a playlist for a user to listen to as they travel to their destination. The playlist will be customized using local weather data, distance, and how hurried the user is. 
- Summary: Playlist creation for travel based on weather and distance.
- Have a feature where you can enter how much time youâ€™re allocating for the trip
    - Ie: in a rush, normal, or slow
