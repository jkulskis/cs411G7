### Idea 1
We want to create a web application that creates a playlist for a user to travel to their destination. The playlist will be customized by four things: user music preferences, local weather data, distance, and how hurried the user is. 
- Playlist creation for travel based on weather and distance
- Have a feature where you can enter how much time youâ€™re allocating for the walk
    - Ie: in a rush, normal, or strolling
- Database
    - Profile info
- Two APIs
    - Spotify
    - Weather
- Third party authentication
    - Spotify

### Idea 2
Sentiment analysis with BU subreddit and creating a playlist from the mood.
- Database
    - Profile info - bu google
- Two APIs
    - Reddit 
    - Spotify
- Third party authentication
    - Google (BU students have a Google Account)
